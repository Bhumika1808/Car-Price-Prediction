# Before updation
### Project summary
This project focuses on building a car resale price prediction system using Linear Regression and a Tkinter-based GUI. It utilizes a dataset (quikr_car.csv) containing car features like brand, model, fuel type, year, and kilometers driven to train the model.

<a href="https://github.com/Bhumika1808/Car-Price_Prediction/blob/main/Quikr%20Analysis.ipynb"> Analysis and Model</a>

A machine learning pipeline with data preprocessing and column transformation was created, and the model was trained multiple times using different random states. The best model, found at random_state=305, achieved a high R² score of 0.89, indicating strong prediction accuracy.

The GUI allows users to select input features and returns an estimated price instantly.

This user-friendly application demonstrates how machine learning can assist in decision-making in the used car market. The project can be scaled further by integrating more advanced models and deploying it on the web for broader usage.
